        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Summer Vacation</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Summer vacation is the happiest time of the year, in the life of a student. We all have experienced the joy
            and even up to this day feel the happiness that it entailed. The feeling of a beginning summer vacation is
            just godly and can’t be expressed in words.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Though, the summer vacation is a time to relax after a long year of school, homework, and exams; it would be
            wise if you spend the time in preparing for the next year’s subject. Buy the books in advance or just borrow
            it from your seniors. Hopefully, you will be able to grasp things better as you have no stress of exams,
            tests or homework deadlines. Whatever you learn during the vacation will help tremendously in the next
            session. As you get familiar with the subjects in advance, it will be only a revision for you when the
            teacher teaches the subject in your next session.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In my opinion, preparing beforehand for your next academic session is the best way to spend your vacation.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Many children might like to spend the time just on insignificant things, but it’s going to be a loss in the end. If you waste your time than after the vacation gets over, you will be left with nothing but to remorse on your loss. I, therefore, advise you to consider my advice and start preparing for the next session. Though, you should also divide the equal time of your vacation for both study and play.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The wisely you spend your vacation; the happier you will be in the end. The time that is wasted can’t be brought back to make the decisions wisely.</p>
